      <h2>So, what makes a Certified Pre-Owned Device you may ask?</h2>
      <p>The used aesthetic device market is littered with “Spray and Pray” resellers that do not have the infrastructure and service connections to ensure your certified pre-owned device functions as originally intended. Our devices both internally and with our partners go through a rigorous inspection process to allow our end user clients to purchase in full confidence.</p>
      <p>Should you wish to protect your investment beyond the industry standard 30 day warranty options, Med-eQuip offers extended 3yr and 5yr warranties on hundreds of devices for a mere fraction of the cost when compared directly from the manufacturer.</p>
      <p>Please use our live chat function or fill out the following device in need form and one of our experienced consultants will contact you shortly.</p>
