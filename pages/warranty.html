      <p>Almost unheard in the used aesthetic device market, Med-eQuip has a unique new partnership to offer 1yr-5yr extended warranties on hundreds of aesthetic devices.</p>
      <p>One of the top three reasons I hear from physicians why they are reluctant to purchase certified pre-owned is because the industry standard 30-45 day warranty is not enough.</p>
      <p>Being able to offer a serious warranty on a certified pre-owned device is an absolute game changer and eliminates all the reluctancy there is when only being able to protect your investment for 30-45 days.</p>
      <p>Should you want an estimate on extending your warranty please fill out the form below and one of our consultants will reach out to discuss your options.</p>
